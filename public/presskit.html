                        modern pop sensibility with indie influences that tugs at your heartstrings.<br>
                        If you’ve been looking for Sweden’s answer to bands like LANY and<br></p>

                    <p id="paragraph3">Since dropping their debut EP “Antidote” in 2019 via Sony Music, the band has<br>
                        been on an upwards trajectory and developed their music into a strong and<br>

                        on big stages and festivals around Sweden and Europe – including as<br>

                        being released later this spring, and the singles 'California' and 'Leaving You<br>
                        Now' confirm that the band is setting the tone for the future of Scandinavian<br>
                        pop. With a distinct visual style and a captivating stage presence,<br>
